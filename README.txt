**Project Description**

Trivia in Transit is an interactive game entertaining and educating through casual and fun short trivia games. While on your way to class, dinner, or another event –– step up to test your cognitive skills and expand your intelligence, and just flex knowledge outside of the classroom! 


**Run Instructions**

Open `index.html` in a Chrome web browser window while connected to Yale secure/vpn.

By default, the game runs using data from the production server, but changing line 92 in index.html (let host = "172.28.142.145:8888";) to the production ip instead allows you to use the production data.

The game works as follows: an individual must be present in front of the TV at the CEID.  If they raise their hand, the game will start, and it will go through the 5 questions. Players must spatially position themselves to the left or right of the screen to answer questions, where a circle on the interface mirrors their position. They can play alone or with a friend! At the end of each session, players can scan a QR code to submit their own questions to the Trivia Pool.
