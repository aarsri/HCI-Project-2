# HCI-Project-2

Open `index.html` in a Chrome web browser window.

Add the following string to the end of the URL to connect to the server: `?ip=[Development_IP]:8888` where `[Development_IP]` is provided in the [Project 2 Tutorial](https://cpsc484-584-hci.gitlab.io/s21/project2_tutorial/#current-server-ips). You can also add the Production_IP instead.

The game works as follows: an individual must be present in front of the TV at the CEID.  If they raise their hand, the game will start, and it will go through the 5 questions.  The player should move to the left or right to actually answer a question and have it be recorded.
