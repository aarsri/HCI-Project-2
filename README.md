### Aarohi Srivastava, Yaa Owusu, Chia Amisola

**Project Description**
Trivia in Transit is an interactive game entertaining and educating through casual and fun short trivia games. While on your way to class, dinner, or another event –– step up to test your cognitive skills and expand your intelligence, and just flex knowledge outside of the classroom! 

**Run Instructions**
Open `index.html` in a Chrome web browser window.

Add the following string to the end of the URL to connect to the server: `?ip=[Development_IP]:8888` where `[Development_IP]` is provided in the [Project 2 Tutorial](https://cpsc484-584-hci.gitlab.io/s21/project2_tutorial/#current-server-ips). You can also add the Production_IP instead.

The game works as follows: an individual must be present in front of the TV at the CEID.  If they raise their hand, the game will start, and it will go through the 5 questions. Players must spatially position themselves to the left or right of the screen to answer questions, where a circle on the interface mirrors their position. They can play alone or with a friend! At the end of each session, players can scan a QR code to submit their own questions to the Trivia Pool.
